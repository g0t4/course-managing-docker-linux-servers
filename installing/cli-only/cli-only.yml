## FROM HERE:
# - confirm units not installed for Docker Engine daemon
# - `systemctl list-sockets  --all`
# - `systemctl list-unit-files  --all`
# - also confirm by docker version as root
# - `sudo docker version` this should still fail to show server side asking if daemon is operational
# - There's no need to add the vagrant user to docker group if no local daemon via a unix socket!
#   - That said, you might want to configure connections (contexts) with ansbile too!
# - You can adapt this playbook to isntall the full Docker Engine (not just client)
#   pkg: docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
# - if desired, follow post-install steps and mod this playbook as an exercise.
#   - notably add the vagrant user to the docker group and ensure you can connect to the daemon too!
